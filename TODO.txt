test and fix:

/invite (maybe display a message for the perosn that was bein invited to let them know)

messages at the channel dont get displayed

/quit ? message in channels where the  person is a member of ? already displays the message inm private message channels. maybe need to check if weechat needs permissions to post in channels

need to read more about weechat WIP

when trying to enter a channel with a passkey and the passkey provided is wrong. add an error message

when doing /nick it tries to reconnect. need to look if thats ok or just skip the error message//

implement being able to send messages in snippets (ctrl + d)

topic gets displayed wrong. also need to show topic when joining a new channel, that has a topic.
